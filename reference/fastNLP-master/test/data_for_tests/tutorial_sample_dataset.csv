A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .	1
This quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .	4
Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .	1
A positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a Shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera .	3
Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .	1
A comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis .	4
Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .	1
The Importance of Being Earnest , so thick with wit it plays like a reading from Bartlett 's Familiar Quotations	3
But it does n't leave you with much .	1
You could hate it for the same reason .	1
There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .	1
Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .	1
The performances are an absolute joy .	4
Fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense .	3
I still like Moonlight Mile , better judgment be damned .	3
A welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story .	3
a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it	3
Like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to Mr. Wong 's In the Mood for Love -- very much a Hong Kong movie despite its mainland setting .	2
As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .	1
It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .	2
Best indie of the year , so far .	4
Hatfield and Hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie 's political ramifications .	3
It 's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend .	1
That the Chuck Norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during Windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is .	2
The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .	2
It arrives with an impeccable pedigree , mongrel pep , and almost indecipherable plot complications .	2
A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .	2
While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .	1
The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen .	1
More vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it 's inoffensive and actually rather sweet .	2
Nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .	2
Hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script ... that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire .	0
Ice Age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .	2
There 's very little sense to what 's going on here , but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash .	2
Cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , The Full Monty , with something different .	2
They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .	1
It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .	1
The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '	0
