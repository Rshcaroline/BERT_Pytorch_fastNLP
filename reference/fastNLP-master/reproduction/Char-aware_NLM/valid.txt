 yesterday 's selling began after a japanese news agency reported that japanese banks which balked at the first bid were ready to reject a revised version at around $ N a share or $ N billion

 people in glass houses tend to look <unk>
 and if still <unk> at the evening 's end you notice something else the audience at first <unk> and <unk> by the music releases its <unk> feelings in collective <unk>
 currently in the middle of a <unk> <unk> tour as a solo <unk> mr. glass has left behind his <unk> equipment and <unk> in favor of going it alone
 he sits down at the piano and plays
 and plays
 either one likes it or one does n't
 the typical glass audience which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers certainly does
 the work though sounds like <unk> for <unk>
 philip glass is the <unk> and his music the new clothes of the <unk>
 his success is easy to understand
 <unk> introducing and explaining his pieces mr. glass looks and sounds more like a <unk> <unk> describing his work than a classical <unk> playing a recital
 the piano <unk> which have been labeled <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> cyclical <unk> and <unk> are <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> and <unk> <unk> but <unk> therefore both pretty and <unk>
 it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task
 it is <unk> listening for the now generation
 mr. glass has <unk> the famous <unk> <unk> less is more
 his more is always less
 far from being <unk> the music <unk> <unk> us with apparent <unk> not so <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of N time <unk> <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
 but the music has its <unk> and mr. glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex
 opening N from <unk> <unk> the audience to the glass technique never <unk> too far from the piano 's center mr. glass works in the two <unk> on either side of middle c and his fingers seldom leave the <unk>
 there is a <unk> musical style here but not a particular performance style
 the music is not especially <unk> indeed it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it
 nothing <unk> no <unk> no <unk> <unk> problems challenge the performer
 we hear we may think inner voices but they all seem to be saying the same thing

 his hands sit <unk> apart on the <unk>
 seventh <unk> make you feel as though he may break into a very slow <unk> <unk>
 the <unk> <unk> but there is little <unk> even though his fingers begin to <unk> over more of the <unk>
 contrasts predictably <unk> first the music is loud then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes <unk> again
 the fourth <unk> play an <unk> from <unk> on the beach is like a <unk> but it does n't seem to move much beyond its <unk> ground in three blind mice
 when mr. glass decides to get really fancy he <unk> his hands and hits a <unk> bass note with his right hand
 he does this in at least three of his solo pieces
 you might call it a <unk> or a <unk> <unk>
 in mad rush which came from a commission to write a piece of <unk> length mr. glass <unk> and <unk> confessed that this was no problem for me an a <unk> with a b section several times before the piece ends <unk>
 not only is the typical <unk> <unk> it is also often multiple in its context s
 mad rush began its life as the <unk> to the <unk> lama 's first public address in the u.s. when mr. glass played it on the <unk> at new york 's <unk> of st. john the <unk>
 later it was performed on radio <unk> in germany and then <unk> <unk> took it for one of her dance pieces
 the point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything
 the evening ended with mr. glass 's <unk> another multiple work
 parts N N and N come from the <unk> of <unk> morris 's <unk> film the thin blue line and the two other parts from <unk> music to two separate <unk> of the <unk> story of the same name
 when used as background in this way the music has an appropriate <unk> as when a <unk> phrase a <unk> minor third <unk> the seemingly endless <unk> of reports interviews and <unk> of witnesses in the morris film
 served up as a solo however the music lacks the <unk> provided by a context within another medium
 <unk> of mr. glass may agree with the critic richard <unk> 's sense that the N music in twelve parts is as <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk>
 but while making the obvious point that both <unk> develop variations from themes this comparison <unk> the intensely <unk> nature of mr. glass 's music
 its supposedly <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that makes one <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> radical <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and what in <unk> even seems like <unk> in <unk>

 the company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial N N stake
 proceeds of the sale expected to be completed next week would be used to repurchase as many as N million shares of honeywell stock the company said
 honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in <unk> but indicated it intends to hold at least N N of the joint venture 's stock long term
 a N N stake would allow honeywell to include <unk> earnings in its results
 honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of <unk> on weapons sales
 yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was pleased with our progress in that regard and hopes to provide additional details soon
 honeywell said its defense and marine systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business
 overall honeywell reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share for the three months ended oct. N compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier

 once again your editorial page <unk> the law to conform to your almost <unk> <unk>

 this statement surely <unk> your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive but it is simply wrong

 it requires that <unk> of <unk> into the waters of the united states be authorized by permits that reflect the <unk> limitations developed under section N
 whatever may be the problems with this system it <unk> reflects zero risk or zero <unk>
 perhaps mr. <unk> was confused by congress 's <unk> statement of the national goal in section N which indeed calls for the elimination of <unk> by N no less
 this <unk> statement was not taken seriously when enacted in N and should not now be confused with the <unk> provisions of the statute
 thus you do the public a great <unk> when mr. <unk> suggests even <unk> that the clean water act prohibits the preparation of a <unk> and water your <unk> readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them as they <unk> in the night with their <unk> and waters from the <unk> knock of the sierra club at their doors

 national geographic the <unk> u.s. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy <unk> pages that upscale advertisers love
 so why did advertising pages plunge by almost N N and ad revenue by N N in the first half
 to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times
 despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to <unk> through in search of <unk> tribe women
 worse it lagged behind competitors in offering <unk> <unk> from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers
 but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign
 advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says joan <unk> who joined in april as national advertising director
 what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance
 people did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't
 the <unk> magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much <unk> before
 it largely <unk> on its <unk> <unk> N million subscribers in the first half up from N million a year ago an average age of N for readers at the <unk> of their <unk> years loyalty to the tune of an N N average subscription renewal rate
 the magazine had its best year yet in N when it <unk> its centennial and racked up a N N gain in ad pages to N
 but this year when the <unk> surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest
 the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national geographic has some <unk> that make it especially <unk> during a soft market
 perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ N for a <unk> page vs. $ N for the <unk> a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation
 when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major <unk> for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all
 even though national geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like <unk> the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says harry glass new york media manager for bozell inc
 to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest N markets
 but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors
 time magazine for example has more than N separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups
 another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of <unk> its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do
 and national geographic 's <unk> size means extra production costs for advertisers
 but ms. <unk> says the magazine is fighting back
 it now offers N regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been <unk> up its sales force
 and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that
 the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about $ N mostly in the next few weeks
 the campaign created by <unk> group 's ddb needham agency takes advantage of the <unk> photography that national geographic is known for
 in one ad a photo of the interior of the <unk> in paris is <unk> with the headline the only book more respected than <unk> does n't accept advertising
 another ad pictures a tree <unk> magnified N times with the headline for impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions
 ms. <unk> says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in N categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food
 her goal to top N ad pages in N up from about N this year
 whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain
 the ad campaign is meant to <unk> the thought of national geographic she says
 we want it to be a <unk> kind of image

 the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to <unk> exchange officials and traders
 the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice
 dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers
 the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange
 while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations
 critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders
 traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders
 the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand
 the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for <unk> traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration
 the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions
 the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them

 so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well
 the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in N
 under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers
 traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves
 a merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit
 it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said
 he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal
