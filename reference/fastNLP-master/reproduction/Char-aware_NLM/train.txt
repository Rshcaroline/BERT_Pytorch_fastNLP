 a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than N years ago researchers reported
 the asbestos fiber <unk> is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said
 <unk> inc. the unit of new york-based <unk> corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in N
 although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem
 a <unk> <unk> said this is an old story
 we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties
 there is no asbestos in our products now
 neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes
 we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said james a. <unk> of boston 's <unk> cancer institute
 dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university
 the <unk> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of <unk> in N
 from N to N N billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said
 among N men who worked closely with the substance N have died more than three times the expected number
 four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer
 the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said
 the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk>
 the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said
 the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters
 the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said
 the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine
 more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained
 in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos
 by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed
 about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s
 areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used
 workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters
 workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area
 there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk>
 but you have to recognize that these events took place N years ago
 it has no bearing on our work force today

 the move leaves united illuminating co. and northeast utilities as the remaining outside bidders for ps of new hampshire which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in chapter N bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company
 new england electric based in <unk> mass. had offered $ N billion to acquire ps of new hampshire well below the $ N billion value united illuminating places on its bid and the $ N billion northeast says its bid is worth
 united illuminating is based in new haven conn. and northeast is based in hartford conn
 ps of new hampshire <unk> n.h. values its internal reorganization plan at about $ N billion
 john rowe president and chief executive officer of new england electric said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to ps of new hampshire such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating <unk> did n't come true
 when we <unk> raising our bid the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years and the rewards seemed a long way out

 mr. rowe also noted that political concerns also worried new england electric
 no matter who owns ps of new hampshire after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation he said
 that attracts attention
 it was just another one of the risk factors that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding he added
 wilbur ross jr. of rothschild inc. the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders said the withdrawal of new england electric might speed up the reorganization process
 the fact that new england proposed lower rate increases N N over seven years against around N N boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders complicated negotiations with state officials mr. ross asserted

 the refund was about $ N million more than previously ordered by the illinois commerce commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility
 state court judge richard curry ordered edison to make average refunds of about $ N to $ N each to edison customers who have received electric service since april N including about two million customers who have moved during that period
 judge curry ordered the refunds to begin feb. N and said that he would n't <unk> any appeals or other attempts to block his order by commonwealth edison
 the refund pool may not be held <unk> through another round of appeals judge curry said
 commonwealth edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing judge curry 's order
 the exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual <unk> made until dec. N of this year
 commonwealth edison said the ruling could force it to slash its N earnings by $ N a share

 the illinois supreme court ordered the commission to audit commonwealth edison 's construction expenses and refund any <unk> expenses
 the utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its N million customers subject to a refund since N

 the survival of spinoff cray computer corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity and <unk> of its chairman and chief designer seymour cray
 not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to mr. cray so is its balance sheet
 documents filed with the securities and exchange commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that cray research inc. will withdraw the almost $ N million in financing it is providing the new firm if mr. cray leaves or if the <unk> project he heads is scrapped
 the documents also said that although the <unk> mr. cray has been working on the project for more than six years the cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype
 moreover there have been no orders for the cray-3 so far though the company says it is talking with several prospects
 while many of the risks were anticipated when <unk> cray research first announced the spinoff in may the <unk> it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday
 we did n't have much of a choice cray computer 's chief financial officer gregory <unk> said in an interview
 the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cray-3 and without him it could not be completed
 cray research did not want to fund a project that did not include seymour
 the documents also said that cray computer anticipates <unk> perhaps another $ N million in financing beginning next september
 but mr. <unk> called that a <unk> scenario
 the filing on the details of the spinoff caused cray research stock to jump $ N yesterday to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading
 analysts noted yesterday that cray research 's decision to link its $ N million <unk> note to mr. cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company
 it has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor said gary p. <unk> of <unk> group inc. minneapolis
 cray computer will be a concept stock he said
 you either believe seymour can do it again or you do n't
 besides the designer 's age other risk factors for mr. cray 's new company include the cray-3 's tricky <unk> chip technology
 the sec documents describe those chips which are made of <unk> <unk> as being so fragile and minute they will require special <unk> handling equipment
 in addition the cray-3 will contain N processors twice as many as the largest current supercomputer
 cray computer also will face intense competition not only from cray research which has about N N of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the <unk> machine a direct competitor with the cray-3 in N
 the spinoff also will compete with international business machines corp. and japan 's big three hitachi ltd. nec corp. and fujitsu ltd
 the new company said it believes there are fewer than N potential customers for <unk> priced between $ N million and $ N million presumably the cray-3 price range
 under terms of the spinoff cray research stockholders are to receive one cray computer share for every two cray research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks
 no price for the new shares has been set
 instead the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide
 cray computer has applied to trade on nasdaq
 analysts calculate cray computer 's initial book value at about $ N a share
 along with the note cray research is <unk> about $ N million in assets primarily those related to the cray-3 development which has been a drain on cray research 's earnings
 <unk> balance sheets clearly show why cray research favored the spinoff
 without the cray-3 research and development expenses the company would have been able to report a profit of $ N million for the first half of N rather than the $ N million it posted
 on the other hand had it existed then cray computer would have incurred a $ N million loss
 mr. cray who could n't be reached for comment will work for the new colorado springs colo. company as an independent contractor the arrangement he had with cray research

 those countries including japan italy canada greece and spain are still of some concern to the u.s. but are deemed to pose <unk> problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the priority list
 gary hoffman a washington lawyer specializing in <unk> cases said the threat of u.s. <unk> combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest prompted the improvements made by south korea taiwan and saudi arabia
 what this tells us is that u.s. trade law is working he said
 he said mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law
 mrs. hills said that the u.s. is still concerned about disturbing developments in turkey and continuing slow progress in malaysia

 the purchases show the strong interest of japanese investors in u.s. <unk> instruments fannie mae 's chairman david o. maxwell said at a news conference
 he said more than N N of the funds were placed with japanese institutional investors
 the rest went to investors from france and hong kong
 earlier this year japanese investors snapped up a similar $ N million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund
 that fund was put together by blackstone group a new york investment bank
 the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman sachs & co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa securities co
 the new seven-year funds one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london interbank offered rate offer two key advantages to japanese investors

 anything 's possible how about the new guinea fund <unk> george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates of <unk> mass
 the recent explosion of country funds <unk> the closed-end fund mania of the 1920s mr. foot says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular
 they fell into <unk> after the N crash
 unlike traditional <unk> mutual funds most of these <unk> portfolios are the closed-end type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly

 what 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios
 after trading at an average discount of more than N N in late N and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of N N

 it 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as south korea some specialists say
 but some european funds recently have skyrocketed spain fund has surged to a startling N N premium

 the newly <unk> premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds mr. porter suggests
 unlike many u.s. investors those in asia or europe seeking <unk> exposure may be less <unk> to paying higher prices for country funds
 there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here mr. porter says
